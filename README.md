# LibGDX_Project_Template_2

Unnecessarily over-engineered crap of a prototype of a LibGDX project, utilizes ObjectManagerInterface from https://github.com/Giedrius-Kristinaitis/DI_Container for dependency injection. Built-in config file reading, refactored resource management, refactored screen handling logic, and more... Built with state updating and rendering separation in mind.

Note: although the template uses dependency injection, you should avoid using it when creating your own game logic, use dependency injection only to customize the template, to avoid coupling the logic to this specific template, but you can still use it if you want to.

Search for TODOs in the code.
