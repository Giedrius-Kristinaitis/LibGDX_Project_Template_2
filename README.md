# LibGDX_Project_Template_2
More advanced prototype of a LibGDX project, utilizes ObjectManagerInterface from https://github.com/Giedrius-Kristinaitis/DI_Container for dependency injection. Separate rendering and updating thread support (optional), built-in config file reading, more flexible frame animations, better resource management, and more... Built with state updating and rendering separation in mind.
